# Hello!

Please download all the files in the folder, not just the index.html file.

(The index.html file links to the styles and javascript in this folder, so if only
the one is downloaded, the page won't load properly)

Once you have downloaded the folder, simply open index.html with chrome.
This should be possible with a right click and 'open with', or you can navigate
to the folder via the command line and write 'open index.html'.

Once open, the page should look like this:

![top o page](/images/top.png)
![bottom](/images/bottom.png)

If it doesn't, something has gone wrong! Do email me an check, and I can put it temporarily
online (this may be easier)


Please note, that currently this only works with desktops, so please don't try to
open it with a mobile, as the comparison slider won't work.

*All the best!*
