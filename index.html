          <strong>You can learn a lot about a painting by simply taking photographs with different types of light.</strong>
          <br/>
          <br />

          Visible light sits within the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVPwGsaHups" target="_blank"><strong>electromagnetic spectrum</strong></a>.
          This is a continuous range of wavelengths that contains different types of radiation, from very high energy, short wavelength gamma radiation down
           to low energy, long wavelength radio waves.
          <br/><br>
          The image below shows where visible light sits on the electromagnetic spectrum; different colours
          of light have different wavelengths, red being the longest and violet the shortest. This is why when white light
          is split up into a rainbow through <strong>refraction</strong> red is always on the top and blue on the bottom.
          <br/>

          <h3>How can we use the electromagnetic spectrum to analyse paintings?</h3>

          <strong>Multispectral imaging</strong> invovles
          taking a variety of pictures of the same object using the different types of frequencies across the
          electromagnetic spectrum. The wavelengths can be separated by filters that
          are sensitive to particular wavelengths. Some paint and pigments react differently
          in different types of light. By comparing a set of images taken with light of different energies
          we can make some interesting assessments in regards to the history and makeup of the painting.

          <p>
            Infra red has a lower frequency than visible light and can penetrate deeper into the painting.
            This means that IR images can reveal the under drawing and underlayers of paintings.
            In this case, it has allowed us to see the detail underneath the cracked as discoloured varnish
            on the girls dress and hair.

          <p>
            Infra red has a lower frequency than visible light and it can penetrate deeper into the painting.
            This means that IR images can reveal the under drawing and underlayers of paintings.

            1000 nm (nanometers) is a lower frequency still than 830 nm, which is why there is slightly more
            detail in this image than the previous one.

          <h3>Infra red false colour</h3>
          <p>
            False colour images are created by splitting a picture taken in visible light into its three different red, green and blue channels.
            The red channel is then deleted and replaced by an infra red image. When combined back together this creates an interesting visual image
            which will highlight details that can only be observed with infra red.

            The lips and tips of the girls fingers appear orange in this image and pink under UV, this indicates the artist
            used a pigment called <a href="http://www.webexhibits.org/pigments/indiv/overview/carmine.html" target="_blank">carmine lake</a>.

          <h3>Raking light</h3>
          <p>
            Here the painting is illuminated from one side, with the light sourde at an extreme angle to the surface.
            This reveals the texture of the paint layer, as raised areas are highglighted and create shadows.

            This image shows clearly the cracking above the girls image an hair as well as the thick paint layer that
            was used to create her sleeve. At the top of her shoulder a section of white paint appears to have flaked away, a fact
            not immidiately obvious in any of the other images

          <h3>UV Flourescence</h3>
          <p>
            UV images are paticularly useful for analysing the varnish layers of paintings.

            On exposure to high energy ultra violet light, some materials will flouresce. Traditional and popular varnishes like
            mastic and dammar give off a greenish colour. New varnishes will not flouresce as much, and so will appear darker
            as they prevent. Dyes, especially red ones, flouresce quite strongly in UV light. Can you spot any areas where a red dyes
            may have been used?

        <section class="UVR">
          <h3>UV Reflectance</h3>
          <p>
            UV reflectance records the radiation that is reflected back from the painting when it is illuminated with an ultraviolet light.
            New varnish layers will reflect darker, which means touch ups to the painting are much more visible in this light. In this image
            you can clearly see a darker spot on the girls nose, which indicates that it has been restored.

          <h3>UV False colour</h3>
          <p>
            This is similar to Infra red false colour, except instead of replacing the red channel with IR, the blue channel is replaced with
            UV reflectance.

          <h3>Transmitted light</h3>
          <p>
            This effect is created when the light source is place behind the canvas.
            This shows where the paint layer is weakest and, in this case, where any significant losses or
            holes are in the canvas. In this case, there are several areas across the painting
            that need to be patched up!
